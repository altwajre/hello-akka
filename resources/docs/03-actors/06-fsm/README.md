# FSM - Overview
- The FSM (Finite State Machine) is available as a mixin for the Akka Actor.
- It is best described in the [Erlang design principles](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-4.9.1/doc/design_principles/fsm.html).
- A FSM can be described as a set of relations of the form:
    - **State(S) x Event(E) -> Actions(A), State(S’)**
- These relations are interpreted as meaning:
    - _If we are in state S and the event E occurs, we should perform the actions A and make a transition to the state S’_.
