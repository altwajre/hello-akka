# Routing - Overview
- Messages can be sent via a **router** to efficiently route them to destination actors, known as its **routees**. 
- A `Router` can be used inside or outside of an actor.
- You can manage the routees yourself or use a self contained router actor with configuration capabilities.
- Different routing strategies can be used, according to your application’s needs. 
- Akka comes with several useful routing strategies right out of the box. 
- It is also possible to [create your own](#custom-router).

# A Simple Router
- See [Example code](./routing-examples/src/main/scala/routing/simple)
- The following example illustrates how to use a `Router` and manage the routees from within an actor.
```scala
class Master extends Actor {
  var router = {
    val routees = Vector.fill(5) {
      val r = context.actorOf(Props[Worker])
      context watch r
      ActorRefRoutee(r)
    }
    Router(RoundRobinRoutingLogic(), routees)
  }

  def receive = {
    case w: Work ⇒
      router.route(w, sender())
    case Terminated(a) ⇒
      router = router.removeRoutee(a)
      val r = context.actorOf(Props[Worker])
      context watch r
      router = router.addRoutee(r)
  }
}
```
- We create a `Router` and specify that it should use `RoundRobinRoutingLogic` when routing the messages to the routees.

### The routing logic shipped with Akka are:
- `akka.routing.RoundRobinRoutingLogic`
- `akka.routing.RandomRoutingLogic`
- `akka.routing.SmallestMailboxRoutingLogic`
- `akka.routing.BroadcastRoutingLogic`
- `akka.routing.ScatterGatherFirstCompletedRoutingLogic`
- `akka.routing.TailChoppingRoutingLogic`
- `akka.routing.ConsistentHashingRoutingLogic`

We create the routees as ordinary child actors wrapped in ActorRefRoutee. We watch the routees to be able to replace them if they are terminated.

Sending messages via the router is done with the route method, as is done for the Work messages in the example above.

The Router is immutable and the RoutingLogic is thread safe; meaning that they can also be used outside of actors.
